## About

Hello! My name is **Mithril Pebel** but you can just call me **Pebel**! I'm a 25 y/o programmer • artist • and brony!

I graduated from Trident University with a Bachelor's degree for Computer Science at the age of 23. My family always told me I was a smart boy and that I will do great things some day. Little did they know that I would grow up to be a horse who makes stupid websites and discord bots. I also liked to draw when I was little and I eventually wanted to turn it into a career when I bought a Wacom Tablet but I only paint and make silly doodles most of the time.

My main inspiration when coding games would have to be [**Pony Town**](https://pony.town)! It's an amazing game! I totally recommend playing it! I play the game alot and I love the way it was built with TypeScript, Angular, and Node.js. I can dream of being a programmer for the game....but I guess only time will tell I suppose.
